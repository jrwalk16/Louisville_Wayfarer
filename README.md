### Brian
- Brian "PM" Habeeb took charge as the make shift SCRUM master of the group and put in alot of hours collaberating with the enitre team to get this project of the ground. With his many years in managing people it was guarenteed to be the right fit. 
### Megan 
- Megan "The artist" Kociscak was the number one pick for all things CSS and visual. She was key in the beautifacation of this website and finally found a use for that masters degree.
### Jeremy
- Jeremy "The iceman" Walker, the former accountant, Mr. Logic himself, spent countless hours researching and implementing code that allowed the team and the project to take shape. Also Jeremy was the git control man, if it was not a sound and coherent pull request, it was not "gitting" merged.

- Both of these sprints due to lack of experience with sprints and agile, we collided these into the same sprint and the major team struggle of the program began.

Wins - Getting to use CSS again more and trying to figure out how to implement different features like the scroll on a series of horizontal images on our homepage.

Struggles - Trying to figure out how to translate angular code into sections that can be supported with individual CSS features. For example how to make something like "(<h1>{{city.name}}</h1>)" into multiple and separate buttons.
