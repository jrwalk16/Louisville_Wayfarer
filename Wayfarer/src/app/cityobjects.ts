        body:  'Golden Gate Bridge: For any one traveling to San Fran a must see is the GGB. We took the "30" minute ride (plan on CA traffic) which took a little under 2 hours and cost $150 (should have rented bikes) to see the world renowned landmark.  Unfortunately, another famous San Fran landmark, the fog, made it nearly impossible to see the 1.7 mi, 750 ft engineering marvel.  Advice to those traveling to SF listen to the infamous quote and stay away during the summer.  However, we did travel north across the bridge to the Golden Gate Bridge national recreation area and were rewarded with an amazing view of the city as the fog cleared quicker than you can say SF GGB.  After snapping iconic photo after photo, we headed north into the Redwood Forrest to camp and enjoy nature.  Follow my travel blog for a review of our campsite. ***'},

    body: "Oracle Park:  As a life-long fan of the game, I decided to take my dad, Harry, on a road trip across America, visiting ballparks along the way.  Our final destination was Oracle Park, in beautiful San Fran.  The views of the bay made the $16 16oz pints completely worth the cost.  Although the Giants beat our hometeam, the Cubs, we were impressed with the modern park and it's amenities.  Individual stalls in the bathrooms, unlike the troughs back home on the Northside, made us feel like we were actually in the 21st centuary.  But beyond that, the Garden, which serves to inspire and educate fans of all ages about sustainability, urban farming, and healthy eating truly blew us away. The two bistros located inside the Garden, Hearth Table and Garden Table, offer a healthy menu featuring fruits and vegetables picked fresh from the Garden. We invite you to explore the aeroponic towers and garden beds in this one-of-a-kind space and enjoy garden-fresh meals at the bistros and garden-inspired beverages at the bar.  Although the game of baseball has been a family friendly outing for well over a century, the Garden proves to carry that tradition well into the future.  ****"},

    body: "Ghirardelli Square:  Along the San Fran waterfront lies the food destination of Ghirardelli Square.  Among the many restaurants that encompass the square there are other attractions, such as, retail stores, activities for all ages, the Ghirardelli Chocolate Factory, San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, and Fisherman's Wharf.  All that being said, I came for the food!  As a huge chocolate lover, the tour of the factory made me feel like I was in candyland, literally.  The shear scale of production made me feel small and at the same time, better about myself knowing that I was not alone in my obsession for this decandant, delicious, delicacy, dessert.  After I had walked for what felt like miles, I realized I was hungry for more than sweets.  So I popped in to Barrio Tacos and Tequila for more than tacos.  The fresh salsa and margs were a great start to the meal.  However, the churros dipped in warm Ghirardelli's dark chocolate sauce spiced with a little cayanne was the perfect end to a scrumptious meal, as well as, a shot of Don Julio 1942 for good measure!  I'll be back.  ***"},

        title: 'Buckingham Palace',
        body:  'The historic London home and administrative center of the British royal family, Buckingham Palace, is an architectual masterpiece and a well known landmark across the world.  Upon touring the property, we learned it was not always so.  Interestingly enough the land on which the palace sits was a marshland.  Although the site was purchased by King James I 400 years ago, it was not the official residence of the monarchy until the 1830s.  The building has gone through many renovations and several architects in its day.  The 830,000 sq. ft. building has 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices and 78 bathrooms.  Some of the more famous rooms being, the Grand Staircase, the State Rooms, where ceremonial events are held, and the Throne Room.  Set aside 2 to 2.5 hours for the tour and 30 pounds, or roughly $40, but it is well worth the time and money spent ***'},

            title: 'Wembley Stadium',
            body:  'As a young footballer growing up in West London, it was a life long dream to step on the pitch at Wembley Stadium to have a knock about with the boys.  Alas, like many young football players that dream did not come to fruition.  However, as an adult, I was able to visit the stadium and watch our beloved English national team take a piss against the Italian side.  It was absolutely horrendous.  Maybe they should hold open tryouts because I know a few lads from the old neighborhood who could have put up a better performance against those Italian premadonas.  The experience did improve as later that night some fellas with real longevity also played on the pitch, The Rolling Stones!  The splendid performance was one for the ages, and at thier age, maybe the last where they are able to make it onto the stage on their own two feet.  The 90,000 seat stadium was packed and rocking.  Definitely will be back for a show, but will wait on another match until we can field a team worth a $#!+.  ***'},

                body:  '"Look kids, there is Big Ben, again!  Said Clark Griswald as they drove round and round the round about viewing the famous clock tower.  We were lucky enough not to get stuck in a time loop, but were disappointed that we could not visit the top because of work being done on the old clock.  When planning a visit to London, make sure to check on the visitation status for the sites you plan on viewing.  All in all it was still a worthwhile site to see up close.  The engineering feat alone was impressive and learning that the clock withstood the aerial bombing by the Luftwaffe made it all the more incredible that the tower has stood since 1859.  **'}
